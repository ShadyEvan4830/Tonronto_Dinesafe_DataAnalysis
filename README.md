## LLM Usage Statement
- `inputs_folder/llm/usage.text` When writing this report, the ChatGPT 4 language model was used to solicit relevant inspiration and suggestions for the economic comparison of obtaining indicators of public food safety (dinesafe). ChatGPT 4 provides the author with some economic indicators that can be compared with dinesafe, such as Consumer Confidence, Business Performance Indicators, etc. (please refer to usage.txt for more details); these suggestions inspired the author and chose the Consumer Price Index as an additional indicator to compare dinesafe.
